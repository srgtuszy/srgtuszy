## Hi there I'm Mike ðŸ‘‹

I'm a developer who specialises in native mobile apps for iOS and Android (in that order) which live on the intersection of physical and digital worlds.

### Some of the stuff I created:

- [MTLabel](https://github.com/srgtuszy/MTLabel) Back in the day, `UILabel` as pretty limited so I rewrote it with some fireworks
- [Base64Stream](https://github.com/srgtuszy/Base64Stream) You have a large base64 encoded file? Convert it to a stream instead!
- [AndroidAr](https://github.com/srgtuszy/AndroidAr) I used to do some AR stuff on Android a while back before ARCore. I shared some of the code I used to make future devs life a little easier.

### I occasionally speak at conferences such as:
