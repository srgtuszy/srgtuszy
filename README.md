## Hi there I'm MikeðŸ”´ ðŸ‘‹ 

I'm a developer who specialises in native mobile apps for iOS and Android (in that order) which live on the intersection of physical and digital worlds. I work at [Intent](https://withintent.com) where I manage one of the mobile engineering teams.

## Tools I use during work 

| iOS ðŸ“± | Android ðŸ¤– | IoT ðŸ¦¾ |
|---------|---------| --------- |
| Swift  | Kotlin  | Arduino |
| SwiftUI  | Jetpack Compose | Raspberry Pi |
| CoreBluetooth  | Android Auto | Espressif |
|  CarPlay | | [BlueZ](http://www.bluez.org) |

I'm also one of those dinasours who worked with Objective-C and UIKit and XML-based Android views.

### Some of the stuff I created:

- [MTLabel](https://github.com/srgtuszy/MTLabel) Back in the day, `UILabel` as pretty limited so I rewrote it with some fireworks
- [Base64Stream](https://github.com/srgtuszy/Base64Stream) You have a large base64 encoded file? Convert it to a stream instead!
- [AndroidAr](https://github.com/srgtuszy/AndroidAr) I used to do some AR stuff on Android a while back before ARCore. I shared some of the code I used to make future devs life a little easier.

### Hackatons

I love taking part in Hackatons. I also managed to win some of them. I'm also a cohost of a podcast which is entirely focused for hackatons: The [HackathonShow](https://open.spotify.com/show/7nzbELP0oEb06j6EM9hCaR?si=403399e906294535). Quite recently, I've won [HackYeah 2023](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KSgIre2zTdk) cybersecurity task
